## Installation



### Angular App :

  

#### Install Angular

Go to temperatureAPP folder using console and enter the following commands:

```npm install -g npm@latest```

```npm install -g @angular/cli```

```npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular```

```npm update```

  

If you face the error ```npm ERR! Unexpected end of JSON input while parsing near '...0","grunt-contrib-wat'```

Then enter the command : ```npm cache clean --force```

  
  

### MySQL server:

  

#### Create the database

Create the database entering these following commands:

```create database tempBDD;```

```use tempBDD; ```

Import the schema of ```tempbdd.sql``` which is in the main folder


### RabbitMQ:

  

#### Installation

RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker. It supports multiple messaging protocols. This message broker have supported a lot of protocols. We will use MQTT plugin for accepting and transferring data from devices (Arduino MKR WiFI 1010).

Default port is ```1883```;

For this project we need to install RabbitMQ server by following this link http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html.

  

After the installation is done, go to the folder, go to the folder C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\RabbitMQ and edit or create a file named ```rabbitmq.config``` and write ```[{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}].``` and save the file.

  

Enter the next command in the console (add to your PATH the folder ```RabbitMQ\rabbitmq_server-3.7.9\sbin``` if you are on Windows): ```rabbitmq-plugins list```

  

With this command, you can take plugins list supported by RabbitMQ server. You need to enable rabbitmq_mqtt with follow command: ```rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_mqtt```

  

Next plugin will give oportunity to use convenient http user interface: ```rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management```

  

Start the Rabbitmq service using the following command: ```rabbitmq-server start```

  

Go on the web-interface ```http://localhost:15672/```. The credentials are: login: ```guest```, password: `guest`, by default.

  

#### Create a queue

Go to the ```Queue``` tab and Add a new queue named ```queue1```

Click on ```amq.topic```.

Open the ```Bindings``` dropdown. Enter ```queue1``` in the 'To queue' input and ```#``` in 'Routing key' input then Bind.
